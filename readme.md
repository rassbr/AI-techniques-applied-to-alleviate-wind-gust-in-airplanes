# What is on the code and repository?

## AI-techniques-applied-to-alleviate-wind-gust-in-airplanestreemaster.pdf
Contains the work in its first (not final) version, explaining the methodology and all the steps. It is also the one that (after some corrections) will be submitted to obtain the title of bachelor in aeronautical engineering.

## Wind_gust_alleviation_code_and_explanation.ipynb
It's a self explainable jupyter notebook containing all information and code used to develop this work.

## NeuralNetworks
Contains some of the neural networks obtained during this work, specially the three used in the result analysis section (verify pdf).
All of them can be loaded with Wind_gust_alleviation_code_and_explanation.ipynb.

## gametoy, parameters and reward
These three are the auxiliary functions which describes the physical model, its evolution, its parameters and the rewards when playing this "game"
