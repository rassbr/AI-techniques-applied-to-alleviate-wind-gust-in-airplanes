# What is on the code?

## Wind_gust_alleviation_code_and_explanation.ipynb
It's a self explainable jupyter notebook containing all information and code used to develop this work.


## NeuralNetworks
Contains some of the neural networks obtained during this work, specially the three used in the result analysis section (verify pdf).
All of them can be loaded with Wind_gust_alleviation_code_and_explanation.ipynb.

## gametoy, parameters and reward
These three are the auxiliary functions which describes the physical model, its evolution, its parameters and the rewards when playing this "game"
